Machine learning for physicochemical properties predictions
=====

<p align="justify"> The physicochemical properties of liquid alternative fuels are important yet challenging to measure or predict, especially when dealing with complex surrogate fuels. Machine learning can be utilised to develop quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models, and an unprecedented mapping between the fuel composition and key properties of fuel utilisation can be established, where the chemical structure of complex fuels can be described using molecular representations. Such QSPR models can reveal the dependence of physicochemical properties of liquid synthetic fuels on fuel mixture chemical composition/chemical structure, which can potentially lead to fully sustainable fuel utilisation, i.e. the engines are 100% powered by sustainable/renewable synthetic fuels. For further details, check our paper published at Energy & AI: [Descriptors-based machine-learning prediction of cetane number using quantitative structureâ€“property relationship](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2024.100385) </p>
