De Novo fuel design
=====

<div align="justify"> Artificial intelligence, such as promising ML tools, has shown potential to revolutionise fuel design formulation by building accurate predictive models for key physicochemical properties of fuel utilisation while also helping to screen fuel mixtures in inverse design formulations. Integrated advanced AI tools can be used to leverage fuel screening, significantly dwindling development timelines and costs compared to the conventional fuel design approach. By leveraging large datasets, AI can accurately predict critical physicochemical properties of fuels, including viscosity, density, energy content, along with combustion characteristics and emissions. ML and big data analytics enable mapping fuel composition to key utilisation properties. Additionally, AI-assisted inverse fuel design frames fuel mixture development as a constrained optimisation problem, identifying compound combinations to achieve the desired properties. These advancements accelerate fuel formulation screening, significantly reducing development timelines and cost.

Machine learning for physicochemical properties predictions
=====

<div align="justify"> The physicochemical properties of liquid alternative fuels are important yet challenging to measure or predict, especially when dealing with complex surrogate fuels. Machine learning can be utilised to develop quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models, and an unprecedented mapping between the fuel composition and key properties of fuel utilisation can be established, where the chemical structure of complex fuels can be described using molecular representations. Such QSPR models can reveal the dependence of physicochemical properties of liquid synthetic fuels on fuel mixture chemical composition/chemical structure, which can potentially lead to fully sustainable fuel utilisation, i.e. the engines are 100% powered by sustainable/renewable synthetic fuels.
