 <div align="justify"> I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Synthetic Fuel Utilisation at the [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). Before this, I held the ["IF@ULB" Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://if-at-ulb.ulb.be/), co-funded by the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and the European Commission within the framework of [MARIE SKLODOWSKA-CURIE actions (H2020)](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/). I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.mecanica.ufrj.br). My research interest is focused on Scientific Machine Learning with applications to fuel property and combustion emission predictions; Molecular dynamics simulation; Thermofluid Modelling/Simulation for Sustainable Energy Utilisation; and Development of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques for calibration and validation of simplified (reduced) chemical kinetics models; Modeling of turbulence-chemistry interactions for combustion models. </div>
