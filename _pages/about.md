<div align="justify"> I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Synthetic Fuel Utilisation at the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London </a>. Before this, I held the <a href="https://if-at-ulb.ulb.be/">"IF@ULB" Postdoctoral Fellowship </a>, co-funded by the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and the European Commission within the framework of <a href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/">MARIE SKLODOWSKA-CURIE actions (H2020) </a>. I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.mecanica.ufrj.br">Federal University of Rio de Janeiro </a>. My research interest is focused on Scientific Machine Learning with applications to fuel property and combustion emission predictions; Molecular dynamics simulation; Thermofluid Modelling/Simulation for Sustainable Energy Utilisation; and Development of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques for calibration and validation of simplified (reduced) chemical kinetics models; Modeling of turbulence-chemistry interactions for combustion models.
